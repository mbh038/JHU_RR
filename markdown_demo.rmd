My first R Markdown file
========================

This is my first R Markdown file.

Here we are going to load some data.

```{r}
library(datasets)
data(airquality)
summary(airquality)
```

Now let's make  a pairs plot of the data

```{r}
pairs(airquality)
```

Here's a regression model of ozone on wind, solar radiation and temperature.

```{r}
library(stats)
fit<-lm(Ozone~Wind+Solar.R+Temp,data=airquality)
summary(fit)
```
Here's an unordered list

* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3

$$
